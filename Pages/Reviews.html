          The world of DARK SOULS has many reviews, here are some of them:

        <div class="Review">
          Dark Souls is known as punishing, unforgiving and very challenging
          game. But it is also very rewarding and satisfying. It is tough, but
          fair (mostly). The game design, the level design, the inter
          connectivity of the world, is outstanding in every possible way. The
          story, yet very vague and cryptic, is more deep and emotional that you
          would have thought. Hidetaka Miyazaki's masterpiece is an
          unforgettable, memorable experience that every serious gamer should
          look for. For example, you pass hours, hours, trying to kill a certain
          boss, getting more and more frustrated. But the moment you land the
          final blow on this boss, you'll feel so happy, satisfied, proud of
          yourself, and the game will reward you for that. It has flaws for
          sure, but this is a complete, and unique gameplay experience. Try it
          someday. Or now, if you haven't already. It is a must-have for every
          gamer looking for a brilliant, unique experience, that you won't find
          anywhere else. 10 /10 <br />

          Having finished Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3 spending a crazy amount
          of time (I still play them), I was hoping to see the HD remaster of
          the first Dark Souls on PS4, but realizing it's not gonna happen in
          the near future, I considered buying PS3 to play it. Am I happy I did
          it? Oh yes! More than happy! I can't find the words to express what a
          greatly constructed and smartly programmed game it is. The detailed
          enormous world here stands out as one of the most spectacularly
          designed ones ever with plenty of enemies/secret passages/traps, you
          name it, and a wide variety of weapons. The first installment delivers
          in spades everything we love about Dark Souls. This game is so
          addictive my sleepless nights have again begun. In a nutshell, if like
          myself you are crazy about Dark Souls 2 and 3, don't hesitate to buy
          an old console to play Dark Souls and Demon's souls. 10/10 <br />
